# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Project
Deepdiving into data of Rockbuster Stealth LLC (a movie rental company) to help launch their online strategy. I will use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project
Introduction: 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC plans to launch an online video rental service amidst stiff competition from streaming giants. As a data analyst in the BI department, the objective is to integrate Rockbuster's diverse datasets into an RDBMS, understand the data landscape, and extract insights using SQL queries. By analyzing customer behavior, inventory trends, and transactional data, strategic decisions will be informed, including pricing strategies, content selection, and operational efficiencies. Insights will be communicated effectively to the Management Board, guiding the launch strategy for the online platform and ensuring Rockbuster remains competitive in the dynamic entertainment market.

# Key Questions
Here are the main questions the project answers:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


Context: 
This project involves using SQL for in-depth data analysis to address queries from different departments, enhancing decision-making for the upcoming online service transition. Skills acquired here are transferable across industries, underscoring problem-solving abilities in data analytics.

Data Set: 
The dataset includes information on Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and transactions, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It's structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
